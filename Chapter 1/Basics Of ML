Basics Of ML
Question and their answer to cover the basics of ML

## 1. How would you define Machine Learning?

👉 Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from data and improve performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.

## 2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?

Spam filtering

Image recognition (e.g., face detection)

Speech recognition (e.g., Siri, Alexa)

Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)

## 3. What is a labeled training set?

👉 A dataset where each input example is paired with the correct output (label).
Example: emails (input) + spam/ham (label).

## 4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?

Classification (predicting categories → spam or not spam)

Regression (predicting values → house prices)

## 5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?

Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation)

Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)

Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)

Association rule learning (e.g., “people who buy X also buy Y”)

## 6. What type of ML algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?

👉 Reinforcement Learning (agent learns by trial and error with rewards/penalties).

## 7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?

👉 Clustering (unsupervised learning).

## 8. Would you frame spam detection as supervised or unsupervised?

👉 Supervised learning (emails labeled as spam/ham).

## 9. What is an online learning system?

👉 A system that learns incrementally as new data arrives, instead of retraining from scratch.

## 10. What is out-of-core learning?

👉 Training on datasets too large to fit in memory, by streaming data in mini-batches from disk.

## 11. What type of algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?

👉 Instance-based learning (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors).

## 12. Difference between model parameter and hyperparameter?

Parameter: learned by the algorithm during training (e.g., weights in linear regression).

Hyperparameter: set before training, controls learning (e.g., learning rate, k in kNN).

## 13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for?

👉 They search for the best parameters that minimize a cost function.
Most common strategy → Gradient Descent.
Predictions → Use the learned function (hypothesis) to make predictions on new data.

## 14. Can you name four main challenges in ML?

Insufficient data

Poor quality data (noise, missing values)

Overfitting (model too complex)

Underfitting (model too simple)

## 15. If your model performs great on training data but poorly on new instances, what is happening?

👉 Overfitting.
✅ Solutions:

Get more training data

Reduce model complexity / add regularization

Clean the training data

## 16. What is a test set, and why use it?

👉 A dataset kept aside to evaluate generalization of the final trained model.
It simulates performance on unseen data.

## 17. What is the purpose of a validation set?

👉 Used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, without touching the test set.

## 18. What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?

👉 Proposed by Andrew Ng for data mismatch problems.

It’s a subset of the training data.

Used to check if the model overfits the training data (vs. mismatch with validation/test).

Helps diagnose whether poor validation results come from overfitting or data mismatch.

## 19. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?

👉 You would leak information from the test set → model indirectly fits the test set → evaluation becomes biased.
Result: Test performance is overly optimistic, and you can’t trust it anymore.
